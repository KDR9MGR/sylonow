- All UI widgets go under `/features/{feature}/screens/`
- Business logic should use Riverpod providers inside `/features/{feature}/provider/`
- Data services like Firebase access go inside `/features/{feature}/data/`
- All reusable widgets should be in `/core/widgets/`
- Each Dart file should have one main purpose (no mixing UI and logic).
- Use StateNotifier or AsyncNotifier for state management.
- Avoid putting multiple classes/functions in one file.\
- Always create widgets for screen specific in /feature/widgets
- Alway make code clean and documented
